### CallMuleSoftAPI

In the **CallMuleSoftAPI** java class you can find sample code to call MuleSoft API. In this scenario simple **GET** request is made and some part of output is written to the debug log.
In my two articles this code comes in handy:

### GenerateJWTToken

In the **GenerateJWTToken** java class you can find sample code to generate JWT token for integration with MuleSoft services.
This piece of code is used and described in the following articles:
* [Secure calls from Salesforce to MuleSoft with JWT](https://ambassadorpatryk.com/2020/07/secure-calls-from-salesforce-to-mulesoft-with-jwt/)
